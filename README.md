# 🌐 Task 8: Working with VPNs



## 🎯 Objective
Understand the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in enhancing privacy and securing online communications by encrypting traffic and masking IP addresses.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This task involved setting up a VPN connection using reputable free services like ProtonVPN or Windscribe. The goal was to experience how VPNs secure data transmission, change IP addresses, and provide online anonymity. The process also explored the impact of encryption on browsing performance and VPN limitations.

---

## 🪜 Steps Performed
1. Signed up for a free VPN service (ProtonVPN / Windscribe).  
2. Installed and launched the VPN client.  
3. Connected to a VPN server (nearest or chosen location).  
4. Verified IP address change using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).  
5. Browsed websites to confirm secure traffic.  
6. Disconnected VPN and compared speed and IP differences.  
7. Researched VPN encryption protocols and privacy features.

## 📊 Findings
| Parameter | Before VPN | After VPN |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| IP Address | Visible public IP | Hidden (Changed location) |
| Encryption | None | AES-256-bit |
| Connection Speed | Normal | Slightly slower |
| Security | Low | High |

## 🧩 Key Learnings
- VPNs protect privacy and secure communication channels.  
- Encryption (AES-256, WireGuard, OpenVPN) ensures data safety.  
- Free VPNs offer limited servers and speed but strong learning value.  
- Trusted VPN providers should always be used for real security.

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
VPNs are critical tools for maintaining online privacy, preventing data interception, and hiding real IP identities. This task provided practical understanding of VPN setup, usage, and how encryption strengthens cybersecurity defenses.
